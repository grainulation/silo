# Changelog

## 1.2.0 — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Smart-fetch module** — size-efficient HTML extraction with semantic heuristics, bounded LRU cache (atomic writes), regression fixtures with opt-in live mode, and an MCP tool (`silo/smart-fetch`)
- `silo fetch <url>` CLI with `--mode auto|concise|full|meta-only`, `--no-cache`, `--privacy`
- `silo cache stats`, `silo cache clear`, `silo cache purge <domain>` for cache management

### Changed

- LRU eviction now uses a monotonic sequence counter instead of timestamps, avoiding millisecond-precision collisions on rapid-fire writes (falls back to timestamps for legacy entries)
- Refactored to use `@grainulation/barn` for MCP JSON-RPC, path guards, and vlog

### Fixed

- Skip caching on redirect to close B2 fully
- Addressed witness and blind-spot findings from the smart-fetch sprint

### Docs

- Added SECURITY.md
